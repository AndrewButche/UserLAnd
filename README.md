## Welcome to UserLAnd

The easiest way to run a Linux distribution or application on Android. 

Can run full linux distros or specific applications on top of Android.
No root required.
Installs and uninstalls like a regular app.

First you define a session - This describes what filesystem you are going to use, what server you want to run (ssh or vnc) and how you want to connect to it (ConnectBot or bVNC).  
As part of defining a session you can define a filesystem - This describes what distro or application you want to install (only supports debian, but more coming soon).
Once that is defined, you just tap on the session to start it up.  
It will download necessary assets, setup the filesystem, start the server and connect to it.  This will take several minutes the first time, but will be quick after that.

This app is fully open source.  You can find our code and file issues here:
